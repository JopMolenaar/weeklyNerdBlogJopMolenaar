### Declarative Design

### music
ways to approch
- classic: notes in a list
- improvise (jazz)

progtamming also 2 ways
- imperative programming: you tell the computer what to do
- Declarative programming, you dont tell the computer what to do: SQL

WWW: 
- html (Declarative) domain specific
- css (Declarative) you giving a suggestion
- js (imperative)  lot more power, but if you make a mistake it doesn't ignore, you can you use it in more places then only the web

its about mindset
imperative: 
more control, desire to control
Declarative:
giving up control

people use js to create a button for instance because of control.
imperative way of thinking

he means js on the client side
"js should only do what only js can do"

mindset css
- imperative: 
> 16px
padding-left

- Declarative:
> 1rem
font-size: calc(0.5rem + 0.666vw): more imperative = clamp(1rem, 0.5rem + 0.666vw, 1.5rem)
padding-inline-start

project utopia.fyi who takes this further

computers are good in maths

book: every-layout.dev
the dev should set the boundaries and let the computer do the math (rest)

be the browsers mentor, not its micromanager

declarative>imperative
his answer: it depends
it depends on: the culture of the nevirioment of the design its happening: management, (culture of the company)

design systems: the design system is the things we do around here
imperative en decl approach

### thinking
analytical thinking
we analize the whole by breaking it apart en understanding that (zooming in)

systems thinking
you look at the whole (zooming out)

design systems: we do analytical because we break it down in parts, not systems like in the name

<!-- he thinks we dont need that approuch -->

designing a button with colors, hexcodes are imperative
the border should be 10% lighter is decl

declearative team? work declearative en andersom

### the medium
print design, native apps, os-specific: needs maybe imperative approuch
but he doesnt think that approuch will work on the www

"the more you tighten your grip, the more ww slips through your fingers"

in the first years of the www it was more a imperative approuch
