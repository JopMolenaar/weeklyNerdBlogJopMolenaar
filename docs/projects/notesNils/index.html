<h2>Nils Binder</h2>
<p>frontend designer</p>
<p>3 units in company =&gt;</p>
<ul>
<li>communication design (logo's print work, non coding)</li>
<li>product dev (developing big apps, data visualitzation)</li>
<li>web development (web dev, small-medium size websites)</li>
</ul>
<h3>wrapper element</h3>
<p>(container)
does:</p>
<ul>
<li>max-width</li>
<li>padding</li>
<li>centers</li>
</ul>
<p>old school:</p>
<ul>
<li>max width 75rem</li>
<li>margin 0 auto</li>
<li>padding 0 1.5rem</li>
</ul>
<p>new way:
width: min(100% - 3rem, 75rem); &quot;&quot;
margin-inline auto &quot;left and right&quot;</p>
<p>shorter way:
magin-inine max(1.5rem, ((100/75rem)/2));</p>
<p>why are we making containers?
posters don't have it</p>
<p>in the past we used photoshop but now we use figma wich has many features from css
and you can make variables and use them in the code</p>
<p>figma came in time where many websites looked the same, to make these kind of websites</p>
<p>but we need to embrace the flexibility because it will look diff in diff situation</p>
<p>but figma has so many less units then we have in css</p>
<p>with grid and 1fr you can make cool dynamic layouts with different white space<br>
1fr only gets content when it is big enough
2fr 3fr auto 1fr
minmax(0, clamp(24rem, 75%, 44rem)); &quot;explanation:  min 24rem, desirded 75% and max 44rem&quot;</p>
<p>conclusion:
use more playfull layouts
and experiment with the white space use
don't center everything</p>
