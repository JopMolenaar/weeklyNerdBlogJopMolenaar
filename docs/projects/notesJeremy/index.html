<h3>music</h3>
<p>ways to approch</p>
<ul>
<li>classic: notes in a list</li>
<li>improvise (jazz)</li>
</ul>
<p>progtamming also 2 ways</p>
<ul>
<li>imperative programming: you tell the computer what to do</li>
<li>Declarative programming, you dont tell the computer what to do: SQL</li>
</ul>
<p>WWW:</p>
<ul>
<li>html (Declarative) domain specific</li>
<li>css (Declarative) you giving a suggestion</li>
<li>js (imperative)  lot more power, but if you make a mistake it doesn't ignore, you can you use it in more places then only the web</li>
</ul>
<p>its about mindset
imperative:
more control, desire to control
Declarative:
giving up control</p>
<p>people use js to create a button for instance because of control.
imperative way of thinking</p>
<p>he means js on the client side
&quot;js should only do what only js can do&quot;</p>
<p>mindset css</p>
<ul>
<li>imperative:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>16px
padding-left</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Declarative:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>1rem
font-size: calc(0.5rem + 0.666vw): more imperative = clamp(1rem, 0.5rem + 0.666vw, 1.5rem)
padding-inline-start</p>

<p>project utopia.fyi who takes this further</p>
<p>computers are good in maths</p>
<p>book: every-layout.dev
the dev should set the boundaries and let the computer do the math (rest)</p>
<p>be the browsers mentor, not its micromanager</p>
<p>declarative&gt;imperative
his answer: it depends
it depends on: the culture of the nevirioment of the design its happening: management, (culture of the company)</p>
<p>design systems: the design system is the things we do around here
imperative en decl approach</p>
<h3>thinking</h3>
<p>analytical thinking
we analize the whole by breaking it apart en understanding that (zooming in)</p>
<p>systems thinking
you look at the whole (zooming out)</p>
<p>design systems: we do analytical because we break it down in parts, not systems like in the name</p>
<!-- he thinks we dont need that approuch -->
<p>designing a button with colors, hexcodes are imperative
the border should be 10% lighter is decl</p>
<p>declearative team? work declearative en andersom</p>
<h3>the medium</h3>
<p>print design, native apps, os-specific: needs maybe imperative approuch
but he doesnt think that approuch will work on the www</p>
<p>&quot;the more you tighten your grip, the more ww slips through your fingers&quot;</p>
<p>in the first years of the www it was more a imperative approuch</p>
