<p>Jeremy Keith is a well known developer that works at Clearleft. He held a presentation about declarative and imperitive design. </p>
<h3 id="DeclarativeDesign">Declarative Design</h3>
<p>He began his presentation with music as an example. There are diofferent ways to approach music. You have the classic way: notes in a list. And you can improvise while making music like jazz. </p>
<p>In programming you have also two ways of doing it. You have imperative programming: you tell the computer what to do and declarative programming, you dont tell the computer what to do.</p>
<p>Here some examples in programming languages:</p>
<ul>
<li>HTML (Declarative) domain specific</li>
<li>CSS (Declarative) you giving a suggestion</li>
<li>JS (client side) (imperative) a lot more power, but if you make a mistake it doesn't ignore, you can you use it in more places then only the web</li>
</ul>
<p>Jeremy said: its all about mindset. Imperative is more control or desire to control. Declarative is giving up control.</p>
<p>People use javascript to create a button for instance, because of control. This is an imperative way of thinking.
But Jeremy says: "js should only do what only js can do". Thats because you get all those browser features for free if you write semantic code. A lot less work and a lot more reliable instead of making it all on your own. </p>
<!-- vanaf hier verder -->
<p>When writing CSS you can write both imperative and decarative. </p>
<ul>
<li>Imperative = 16px </li>
<li>Declarative = 1rem</li>
</ul>
<p><code>font-size: calc(0.5rem + 0.666vw);</code> is more declarative then <code>font-size: clamp(1rem, 0.5rem + 0.666vw, 1.5rem);</code>. And padding-inline-start is also an example of a more declarative approach in css. Designing a border with colors or hexcodes is imperative. But designing the the border and saying that is should be 10% lighter is declarative. </p>
<p>Project utopia.fyi takes this further. </p>
<p>Jeremy also says that computers are good in maths. He showed a book "every-layout.dev" that says that the developer should set the boundaries and let the computer do the math (rest). Be the browsers mentor, not its micromanager. </p>
<p>He gave us the question "What is better?" and said: it depends. It depends on: the culture of the environment of the design its happening: management, (culture of the company).</p>
<h3 id="Thinking">Thinking</h3>
<p>Analytical thinking, we analize the whole by breaking it apart en understanding that (zooming in).
Systems thinking, you look at the whole (zooming out).</p>
<!-- Design systems (the design system is the things we do around here, imperative en decl approach): we do analytical because we break it down in parts, not systems like in the name -->

<!-- he thinks we dont need that approuch -->

<p>He asked us the question about what kind of enviorment we want to work in in the future. The declearative team or imperatave team? </p>
<h3 id="Themedium">The medium</h3>
<p>Print design, native apps, os-specific: need maybe an imperative approuch, but he doesn't think that approuch will work on the www.</p>
<p>"The more you tighten your grip, the more the www slips through your fingers"</p>
<p>In the first years of the www it was more a imperative approuch but that is changing now. </p>
<h2 id="Mythoughts">My thoughts</h2>
<p>I liked Jeremy's persentation a lot. He is such a good speaker and nice to listen to. The subjects imperative and declarative were totally new for me and got me started thinking about what kind of person I am and what I perfer. </p>
<p>I like javascript a lot so I thought I was leaning more to the imperative side. But I like javascript because of the logic that you can write, not because that it is imperative. And behind the declarative css can also be a lot of logic. I like the declarative approach more then the imparative approach for web design. It will be less work in the end. And when you forget something you don't get punished.</p>
